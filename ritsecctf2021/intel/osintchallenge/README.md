The CEO of Genoâ€™s company loves local art and nature. Where was she when she took the photo in her Twitter background? (Wrap the answer in RS{} and use underscores between each word.)

## Solution

If we look back to Geno's Linkedin page from the "Finding Geno" challenge, we can see that his company's Linkedin page is linked:

![Geno Ikonomov's Linkedin profile](./resources/linkedin0.png)

By following this link, we can identify the CEO as Dr. JoAnne Turner-Frey:

![Bridgewater Investigations Linkedin page](./resources/linkedin1.png)

From her name, we can search for her Twitter account:

![Twitter search](./resources/twitter0.png)

Her profile is the one with the matching name and profile picture.

On her profile, we can see the image in question.
We also see that she is a resident of Rochester, New York, USA.

The challenge specifies that she loves local art and nature, so we can assume that the picture is taken from or near Rochester.
Using this information, we can search for the location and details of the image:

![Google search for "rochester peace sign park"](./resources/google0.png)

Following the Google Maps preview, we can see that this is the same place as in the Twitter banner:

![Google Maps satelite view](./resources/google1.png)

![Google Maps images](./resources/google2.png)

The features in the image are identical to the features in JoAnne Turner-Frey's Twitter profile.
We can be confident that the photo was taken in Durand Eastman Park.
