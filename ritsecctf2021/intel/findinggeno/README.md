We know that our missing personâ€™s name is Geno and that he works for a local firm called Bridgewater. What is his last name? (Wrap the answer in RS{})

## Solution

We start by googling `geno bridgewater`:

![Google results for "geno bridgewater"](./resources/google0.png)

As we can see, there are a number of irrelevant results.
We can filter the first of these by removing results that include `homes`:

![Google results for "geno bridgewater -homes"](./resources/google1.png)

Again, there are irrelevant results.
These can also be removed by filtering out `football` related results:

![Google results for "geno bridgewater -homes -football"](./resources/google2.png)

We find his LinkedIn which includes his full name:

![Geno Ikonomov LinkedIn](./resources/linkedin.png)
