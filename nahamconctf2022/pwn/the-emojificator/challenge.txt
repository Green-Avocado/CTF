Emojis are actually very cool. Emojis have byte representations under the hood, and you can look at it in Python with "⚠️".encode('utf-8')!

But for the emoji mathificator, we've added more fun. If you want to get some bytes out of an emoji, just tell us which byte you want using the clock emojis! If "⚠️".encode('utf-8') is b'\xe2\x9a\xa0\xef\xb8\x8f', then ⚠️🕐 (one o'clock) will give you the first byte, \xe2!

But here's where it gets crazy. Say you want to add two bytes together before they get processed? No problemo my friend! Just use the ➕ emoji! So ⚠️🕐➕⚠️🕐 gives the byte \xc4 (\xe2 + \xe2 % 256 is \xc4). Since we're really bananas, you can even subtract them. With the emoji mathificator, there's nothing you can't do.

You can even run code! Start your emojis with 🏃 and we'll run the bytes that result. Truly nothing is as powerful as the mathificator!
