# Tenbagger

## Challenge

We are given a pcapng file with noise.

### Description

I think I took it too far and made some trades and lost everything. My only chance to fix my account balance is a tenbagger.

## Solution

Looking at the packets, we can see that noise was generated by vising "the annoying site".
We can remove this noise by filtering out https traffic.

Of the remaining TCP packets, we can see that there are unencrypted FIX packets, a finance protocol.

Upon closer inspection, some packets have comments such as "fl" and "ag{".

Listing all these comments gives us the flag:

```
-> % tshark -r public/tenbagger.pcapng -V | grep "Text"
    Text (58): fl
    Text (58): ag{
    Text (58): t0_th
    Text (58): 3_
    Text (58): m00n
    Text (58): _4
    Text (58): n
    Text (58): d_b4c
    Text (58): k}
```

## Flag

`flag{t0_th3_m00n_4nd_b4ck}`
