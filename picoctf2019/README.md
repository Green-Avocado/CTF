Note: The challenges in this repository were completed during the CTF, with the exception of binary-exploitation/NewOverflow-1 (more information in the writeup).
Some challenges have been revisited and solved in the interest of producing a write-up to document my process, however, most challenges were omitted.
I've chosen to focus on challenges in which I felt I learned a lot, or ones that became an important foundation for later events.

## Write ups:

### binary exploitation

 - [practice-run-1](./binary-exploitation/practice-run-1)
 - [handy-shellcode](./binary-exploitation/handy-shellcode)
 - [OverFlow-0](./binary-exploitation/OverFlow-0)
 - [OverFlow-1](./binary-exploitation/OverFlow-1)
 - [OverFlow-2](./binary-exploitation/OverFlow-2)
 - [NewOverFlow-1](./binary-exploitation/NewOverFlow-1)

### reverse engineering

I decided against including the vault challenges, as they seemed pretty straightforward.
Instead, I've decided to focus on the asm challenges that I was able to solve, as this was my introduction to reversing binaries.

 - [asm2](./reverse-engineering/asm2)
 - [asm3](./reverse-engineering/asm3)
