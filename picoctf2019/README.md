Note: The challenges in this repository were completed during the CTF, with the exception of binary-exploitation/NewOverflow-1 (more information in the writeup).
Some challenges have been revisited and solved in the interest of producing a write-up to document my process, however, most challenges were omitted.
I've chosen to focus on challenges in which I felt I learned a lot, or ones that became an important foundation for later events.
