# practice-run-1 - Points: 50

## description

You're going to need to know how to run programs if you're going to get out of here. Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this [program](./run_this) to receive a flag.

## solution

As per the description, simply connecting to the shell server and running the binary will print the flag.

## exploit script

I used pwntools to connect to the shell server and start the process.

```
#!/usr/bin/python
from pwn import *
from getpass import getpass

pico_user = input("Username: ")[:-1]
pico_pass = getpass("Password: ")

conn = ssh(host = '2019shell1.picoctf.com', user = pico_user, password = pico_pass)

location = '/problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e'

print("running vuln")
vuln = conn.process(location + '/run_this')
flag = vuln.recvline().decode()[:-1]
print(flag)

print("done")
```

Flag: ```picoCTF{g3t_r3adY_2_r3v3r53}```
