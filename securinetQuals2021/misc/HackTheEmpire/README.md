Important: Whatever was the solution that you're going to adopt, if you want to use webhooks, DO NOT USE any of those that allows other participants to see the flag (don't use webhook.site, you may let other participants to catch the flag from there) (for example you can use requestbin instead of webhook.site since the flag can be seen by the authenticated user). Think about using a method that will not leave anybody else to read the flag from your steps. And don't forget to remove your work after you solve the task to avoid anybody else to steal it.

Hint 1: find the original web page (in the original website) that was sharing what you've found since that page is not updated
