# UBC Maple CTF 2022

https://ctf.maplebacon.org/

These are challenges I wrote for the UBC Maple CTF 2022 event.
The event was exclusive to UBC students.

The pwn challenges explore

- integer underflow
- buffer overflow
- return-oriented programming
- format string vulnerabilities

The misc challenges are designed to help new players learn how
to read and write raw bytes to a TCP connection, which is important
for most binary exploitation challenges in CTFs.
